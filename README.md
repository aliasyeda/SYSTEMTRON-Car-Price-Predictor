# SYSTEMTRON-Car-Price-Predictor

🚗 systemtron-car-price-predictor – ML Internship Project
This project is developed as part of my Machine Learning Internship under SystemTron, where the main goal is to predict the selling price of a car based on various features using regression models.

📌 Project Objective
T
he objective of this project is to:

Build a Machine Learning model that predicts car prices accurately.

Use both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models.

Evaluate the model using standard error metrics.

Visualize and interpret results clearly.

🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset contains various details of used cars, including:

Car Name

Year of Purchase

Present Price

Fuel Type

Transmission Type

Owner Type

Kilometers Driven

The target variable is:

Selling Price of the car.

🧪 Workflow & Steps

Data Collection

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns.

Converted categorical features into numerical using encoding.

Handled missing values and prepared the data for training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized trends and relationships using plots.

Identified key influencing features for car price prediction.

Model Training

Built and trained two models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Random Forest model performed better than Linear Regression.

Prediction and Visualization

Predicted values vs Actual values plotted.

Displayed MAE and RMSE on the graph for clarity.

✅ Results Summary

Linear Regression R² Score: ~0.68

Random Forest R² Score: ~0.82

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Around 9800

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Displayed in the plot

📌 Key Learnings

How to clean and preprocess real-world structured data.

How to build and evaluate regression models in ML.

The benefits of ensemble models like Random Forest.

How to visualize and interpret results clearly.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🏁 Conclusion
This project, developed for the SystemTron Machine Learning Internship, demonstrates a complete ML workflow for regression-based prediction. It showcases how to go from raw data to a fully trained, evaluated, and visualized ML model for predicting car prices.
